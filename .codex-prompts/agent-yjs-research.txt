Research Yjs CRDT integration for draw.io XML documents. Analyze these specific aspects:

1. XML/Text document handling: How Yjs handles structured XML documents (not just rich text)
2. Conflict resolution: How conflicts are resolved for structured diagram data (nodes, edges, positions)
3. Memory footprint: Memory usage for large diagrams with 1000+ nodes
4. React 19 integration: Proven patterns for integrating Yjs with React 19 and Next.js
5. Persistence strategies: PostgreSQL storage vs file-based storage for Yjs documents
6. Performance: Real benchmarks from production projects, not marketing claims

Report format:
- Recommended integration approach with code examples
- Specific risks and mitigation strategies
- Performance characteristics (latency, memory, bandwidth)
- Exact library versions to use
- Alternative approaches if Yjs isn't suitable
