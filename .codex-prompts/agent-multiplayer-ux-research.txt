1. Cursor presence: How to show other users' cursors, position tracking, smoothing
2. User identification: Avatar, name labels, color coding per user
3. Selection indicators: Showing what other users have selected, highlighting
4. Conflict awareness: Visual feedback when editing same elements, subtle warnings
5. Viewport following: Option to follow another user's viewport, permissions
6. Performance: Rendering 10+ cursors without lag, optimization techniques
