Research WebSocket server architecture for Next.js 16 App Router. Analyze these specific aspects:

1. Server implementation: Next.js API routes as WebSocket server vs separate Node.js server
2. Connection management: Handling 100+ concurrent connections, connection pooling
3. Authentication: WebSocket auth using Better Auth sessions, validating session cookies
4. Scaling: Horizontal scaling with multiple server instances, Redis pub/sub
5. Deployment: VPS deployment considerations (sgp1-02: 209.38.58.83), process management
6. Libraries: Recommended WebSocket libraries for Next.js (ws, socket.io, y-websocket)

Current stack:
- Next.js 16 with App Router
- Better Auth for sessions
- PostgreSQL on VPS
- Target: 5+ concurrent users, <200ms sync latency

Report format:
- Recommended server architecture with diagrams
- Code examples for auth and connection handling
- Scaling strategy for production
- Deployment configuration
- Library versions and alternatives
