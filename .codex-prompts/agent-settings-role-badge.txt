TASK: Add role badge + admin panel link to settings-dialog.tsx

PROJECT: canvas-A-I-O (Next.js 16 + React 19 + Better Auth + Tailwind CSS 4)
WORKING DIR: /mnt/c/Users/Kratos/canvas-A-I-O

CONTEXT:
We have an RBAC system with 4 roles: owner > admin > editor > viewer.
The settings dialog already has a User Profile section showing email + sign out button.
We need to add: (1) a role badge pill next to the profile info, (2) an admin panel link for admin/owner users.

EXISTING FILES TO READ FIRST:
1. components/settings-dialog.tsx - the main file to modify (638 lines)
2. hooks/use-permissions.ts - client-side permission hook (already created)
3. lib/i18n/dictionaries/en.json - has "admin" section with i18n keys

KEY STRUCTURE in settings-dialog.tsx:
- Line 126: `const { data: session } = authClient.useSession()`
- Lines 300-323: User Profile SettingItem showing email + sign out button
- Line 324+: API Keys section follows

WHAT TO IMPLEMENT:

1. Import `usePermissions` from "@/hooks/use-permissions" at the top
2. Import `Shield` icon from "lucide-react" (add to existing import)
3. Inside the SettingsContent component (after the session destructure), add:
   `const { role, isAdmin } = usePermissions()`

4. MODIFY the User Profile SettingItem (lines 300-323):
   - Change the description to include the role badge
   - After the description text showing the email, add a small role badge pill:
     ```tsx
     <span className={`ml-2 inline-flex items-center rounded-full px-2 py-0.5 text-xs font-medium ${
       role === "owner" ? "bg-amber-500/10 text-amber-600 dark:text-amber-400" :
       role === "admin" ? "bg-blue-500/10 text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400" :
       role === "editor" ? "bg-green-500/10 text-green-600 dark:text-green-400" :
       "bg-gray-500/10 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400"
     }`}>
       {role.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + role.slice(1)}
     </span>
     ```
   - The badge goes in the description area of SettingItem. Since SettingItem takes a string description,
     you may need to change the User Profile section to put the badge BELOW the SettingItem or modify
     the description to include it. The simplest approach: Add the badge as a separate element after the
     SettingItem description text, inside the SettingItem's children or by making description accept ReactNode.

   ACTUALLY, looking at the code more carefully:
   - SettingItem renders description as a plain string in a <p> tag
   - Simplest approach: DON'T modify SettingItem. Instead, after the existing User Profile SettingItem (line 322 close),
     add a NEW element that shows the role badge and admin link INSIDE the same session?.user block.

5. ADD an Admin Panel link after the User Profile SettingItem but still inside the `{session?.user && (...)}` block:
   ```tsx
   {isAdmin && (
     <SettingItem
       label={dict.admin?.panel || "Admin Panel"}
       description={dict.admin?.panelDescription || "Manage users, roles, and permissions"}
     >
       <Button
         variant="ghost"
         size="sm"
         className="h-9 w-9 p-0"
         onClick={() => {
           const segments = pathname.split("/").filter(Boolean)
           const lang = segments[0] || "en"
           router.push(`/${lang}/admin`)
         }}
       >
         <ChevronRight className="h-4 w-4" />
       </Button>
     </SettingItem>
   )}
   ```

6. For the role badge, the cleanest approach is to modify the User Profile SettingItem's description prop to include the role.
   Change line 304 from:
   ```
   description={`${dict.auth.signedInAs} ${session.user.email}`}
   ```
   to:
   ```
   description={`${dict.auth.signedInAs} ${session.user.email} (${role.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + role.slice(1)})`}
   ```
   This is the SIMPLEST approach that doesn't require modifying SettingItem component.

RULES:
- Do NOT create new files, only modify settings-dialog.tsx
- Keep changes minimal - only add what's described above
- Use existing patterns (SettingItem, Button, etc.)
- Run `npx tsc --noEmit` after changes to verify no type errors
- Run `npx biome check --write components/settings-dialog.tsx` to auto-fix formatting
