## Features

### 🎯 Core Capabilities
- **draw.io Integration**: Seamlessly wraps draw.io (https://github.com/jgraph/drawio) with AI-powered enhancements
- **Offline Desktop App**: Full offline functionality through Electron desktop version (https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop)
- **Natural Language Commands**: Create and manipulate diagrams using simple text prompts
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Works as web application (Vercel/Cloudflare) and standalone desktop app

### 🤖 AI-Powered Features
- **LLM-Powered Diagram Creation**: Leverage Large Language Models to create and manipulate draw.io diagrams directly through natural language commands
- **Image-Based Diagram Replication**: Upload existing diagrams or images and have the AI replicate and enhance them automatically
- **PDF & Text File Upload**: Upload PDF documents and text files to extract content and generate diagrams from existing documents
- **AI Reasoning Display**: View the AI's thinking process for supported models (OpenAI o1/o3, Gemini, Claude, etc.)
- **Diagram History**: Comprehensive version control that tracks all changes, allowing you to view and restore previous versions
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Communicate with AI to refine your diagrams in real-time
- **Cloud Architecture Diagram Support**: Specialized support for generating cloud architecture diagrams (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- **Animated Connectors**: Create dynamic and animated connectors between diagram elements

## MCP Server (Preview)

> **Preview Feature**: This feature is experimental and may not be stable.

Use AIO Canvas with AI agents like Claude Desktop, Cursor, and VS Code via MCP (Model Context Protocol).

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "drawio": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@canvas-a-i-o/mcp-server@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code CLI

```bash
claude mcp add drawio -- npx @canvas-a-i-o/mcp-server@latest
```

Then ask Claude to create diagrams:
> "Create a flowchart showing user authentication with login, MFA, and session management"

See the [MCP Server README](./packages/mcp-server/README.md) for VS Code, Cursor, and other client configurations.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PhenixStar/canvas-A-I-O.git
cd canvas-A-I-O
npm install
cp env.example .env.local
```

2. Configure environment variables in `.env.local`:

See the [Provider Configuration Guide](./docs/en/ai-providers.md) for detailed setup instructions for each provider.

### Development

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:6002](http://localhost:6002) in your browser.

**Bring Your Own API Key**: Configure your provider and API key via the Settings icon in the chat panel. Keys are stored locally in your browser.

## Platform Support

### 🌐 Web Application (Online)
- Hosted on Vercel or Cloudflare
- Real-time AI collaboration
- Browser-based draw.io functionality
- Cross-platform access

### 💻 Desktop Application (Offline)
- Electron-based desktop app
- Full offline functionality
- Native performance and integration
- Windows, macOS, and Linux support

## Available Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start development server on port 6002 |
| `npm run build` | Build for production |
| `npm run start` | Start production server on port 6001 |
| `npm run lint` | Run Biome linter |
| `npm run format` | Format code with Biome |
| `npm run electron:dev` | Start Electron desktop app in development |
| `npm run dist` | Build desktop distributions |

## Deployment

### 🌐 Production Instance

**Live Deployment**: [https://draw.nulled.ai](https://draw.nulled.ai)

- **Platform**: Docker containers with Caddy reverse proxy
- **SSL**: Let's Encrypt (auto-renewing)
- **Features**: Full AI diagram generation capabilities
- **Status**: Production-ready

### Vercel

Deploy using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new):

1. Import your repository
2. Configure environment variables in the Vercel dashboard (same as `.env.local`)
3. Deploy

### Cloudflare Workers

[Go to Cloudflare Deploy Guide](./docs/en/cloudflare-deploy.md)

### Docker

[Go to Docker Guide](./docs/en/docker.md)

### Offline Deployment

[Go to Offline Deployment Guide](./docs/en/offline-deploy.md)

## Multi-Provider Support

- AWS Bedrock
- OpenAI
- Anthropic
- Google AI
- Google Vertex AI
- Azure OpenAI
- Ollama
- OpenRouter
- DeepSeek
- SiliconFlow
- ModelScope
- SGLang
- Vercel AI Gateway

All providers except AWS Bedrock and OpenRouter support custom endpoints.

**[Detailed Provider Configuration Guide](./docs/en/ai-providers.md)**

### Server-Side Multi-Model Configuration

Administrators can configure multiple server-side models available to all users without requiring personal API keys. Configure via:

- `AI_MODELS_CONFIG` environment variable (JSON string)
- `ai-models.json` file

**Model Requirements**: This task requires strong model capabilities for generating long-form text with strict formatting constraints (draw.io XML). Recommended models:

- Claude Sonnet 4.5
- GPT-4.1 / GPT-5.1
- Gemini 2.5 Pro
- DeepSeek V3 / R1

> **Note**: The `claude` series has been trained on draw.io diagrams with cloud architecture logos (AWS, Azure, GCP). Best choice for cloud architecture diagrams.

## How It Works

### Technology Stack

- **Next.js**: Frontend framework and routing
- **Vercel AI SDK** (`ai` + `@ai-sdk/*`): Streaming AI responses and multi-provider support
- **react-drawio**: Diagram representation and manipulation
- **Electron**: Desktop application wrapper
- **Radix UI**: Component primitives

### Data Flow

Diagrams are represented as XML that can be rendered in draw.io. The AI processes natural language commands and generates or modifies this XML accordingly.

```
User Input → AI Provider → XML Generation → react-drawio Rendering → Display
```
